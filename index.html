      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hey there! I'm just a guy with a passion for knowing how things work, and using that knowledge to help the people around me as best I can. Always the kid who took stuff apart for the sheer curiosity, computer sciences drew me in like a moth to flame. I've earned two AA degrees, one in Computer Programming and the other in Network Systems, and my hunger to learn has only grown as I've chased my passions. I can only hope to keep learning so I can create new solutions for the world around me.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>The Plains, OH</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Cooking, gaming, and writing! Though not necessarily in that order.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'd love to find a place in cybersecurity, but anywhere that allows me to help people with the knowledge I've gained would be a solid fit.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>A small apartment in Pinveille, NC!</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>As the world's technologies develop and more and more functionality is placed in online applications, an intimate and working knowledge of online technologies and web development is growing increasingly important in today's world; I simply want to do what can have the most impact, and despite wanting to get into cybersecurity, I feel that web development will become an increasingly important part in that endeavor.</p>
